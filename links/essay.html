        <p><strong>Was Christopher Columbus in Greenland 15 years before he discovered 
          America?</strong></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Christopher Columbus wrote that he sailed in February 1477 
          to an island a hundred miles beyond Tile (Iceland). This trip, which 
          would have led him to Greenland according to the distance he mentioned, 
          was questioned many times in the 20th century. Ar&shy;guments against 
          accepting his claim have been that ice and snow would not have allowed 
          him to make an expedition to the North in winter, and that the details 
          he had given about the size of the tides (26 braccia) were far too overstated 
          to be taken seriously. Taking into consideration new research concerning 
          the change of climate at the end of the Middle Ages, Columbus' statement 
          must be re&shy;considered in our days. It seems to be consistent not 
          only with the climatic facts at that time, including extremely high 
          and low tides, but also with the historical sources documenting the 
          competition among European countries with regard to Greenland as a base 
          for further advances to Newfoundland and Canada. This short essay shows, 
          that there are substantive historical and climatic arguments supporting 
          Christopher Columbus' claims.</strong></p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Commenting on the five earthly zones and their habitability as de&shy;scribed 
          by Isidore of Seville in his treatises Etymologiae and De Natura Rerum, 
          Columbus wrote in one of the rare records of his early seafaring time: 
          In the month of February, 1477, I sailed a hundred leghe (miles) beyond 
          Tile (Iceland), to an island, of which the south part is at a distance 
          of 73 degrees from the equator, and not 63, as some say; and it does 
          not lie within Ptolemy's western boundary, but much farther west. And 
          to this island, which is as big as England, the English, especially 
          those from Bristol, go with their wares. When I was there, the sea was 
          not frozen, although there were very big tides, which in some places 
          rose and fell twenty-six braccia (cubit).[1] Unfortunately, the original 
          document containing these words is lost. However, it is available in 
          two reliable contemporary transcriptions, one by Her&shy;nando Col&oacute;n, 
          son of Christopher Columbus, and the other by Bartolom&eacute; de las 
          Casas, fighter for the rights of the native Indians.</p>
        <p>Sailing a distance of a hundred miles beyond Iceland one is lead either 
          to the island of Jan Mayen or to Greenland. Jan Mayen is rather unlikely 
          as Columbus' destination, because of its small size (not to be compared 
          with England). Moreover, Christopher Columbus wrote that the place he 
          went to was located further west than the line Ptolemy had described 
          to be the edge of the western hemisphere, and Jan Mayen is located in 
          the North. In Considering Greenland as a possible destination, there 
          is only one inaccuracy in the text, that the island's south part had 
          a distance of 73 degrees from the Equator. Did Columbus confuse the 
          East-, with the South coast of Greenland, or are there other reasons, 
          which may account for this mistaken detail?</p>
        <p>First of all, one has to be aware, that in the 15th century it was 
          generally very difficult to determine a ship's exact position. To measure 
          latitude Columbus still used the Quadrant: a quarter cir&shy;cle cut 
          from wood or brass.[2] In addition, Alexander Humboldt &#8211; himself 
          an experienced explorer &#8211; pointed out that the diffuse sunlight 
          in the North, especially in winter, made it very difficult to obtain 
          precise readings.[3]</p>
        <p>But it isn't just the possibility of a wrong measurement leading to 
          the questionable statement of latitude. Columbus' error could also be 
          the result of an inaccurate statement of Ptolemy. The ancient geographer, 
          with whom Columbus was familiar, gave the latitude of the northwest 
          coast of Ireland &#8211; corner point of Colum&shy;bus' departure across 
          the open sea &#8211; as 61 instead of 55 ? degrees North.[4] In this 
          context, it cannot be ruled out that Columbus reached a place at a distance 
          of about 73 degrees north of the Equator. If he participated in an expedition 
          to Greenland that winter, he might have made his own investigations 
          about the habitability of one of the earthly zones and, taking advantage 
          of the East Greenland current, made an expedition to the bays north 
          of Soorebysund. He might even have rounded the spit of land later called 
          James Land.</p>
        <p>Apart from this error in the measurement of latitude, Co&shy;lumbus' 
          statements are clearly referring to Greenland. As the source itself 
          has never been doubted, it is astonishing that Christo&shy;pher Columbus' 
          notes have not been taken seriously in historiog&shy;raphy and why this 
          trip of his is still unknown. Ignoring the fact that there is a genuine 
          text in the handwriting of Columbus de&shy;scribing his stay in Galway 
          (Ireland)[5], some historians even refuse to accept that Columbus went 
          as far as England. Looking at some of the statements of the Columbus 
          research literature in the 20th century, one gets the impression, that 
          the influence of positivist thinking in historical research, combined 
          with nationalistic goals, led to a hypercritical view towards Columbus' 
          own writings. After the debate concerning the possible impact on the 
          discoverer of America by the expeditions of the Vikings initiated by 
          Scandina&shy;vian scientists in the 19th century and continuing until 
          the second half of the 20th century[6], it was generally agreed that 
          Columbus sailed at least as far as Iceland. But since the thirties, 
          Italian histo&shy;riograpghy, especially the so-called Genoese School, 
          started to dis&shy;count the sourcepassage, arguing that such a trip 
          would not have been in the interests of a Genoese merchant[7]. According 
          to one of the most recent essays about the subject by the British historian 
          Ruddock, Columbus invented his trip to the North, after having listened 
          to the narratives of British sailors.[8] But what are the con&shy;crete 
          arguments brought up against taking the quotation of Chris&shy;topher 
          Columbus at face value?</p>
        <p>The most important argument advanced during the last century is concerning 
          the time of the year (February), which would seem to make a trip even 
          to Iceland impossible because of ice and snow. However nowadays, this 
          objection may not be valid any&shy;more. It is now known that in the 
          15th century the climate was much warmer than in following centuries.[9] 
          According to a contempo&shy;rary chronicle, the winter of 1477 was extraordinarily 
          mild: even the northern part of Iceland was without any snow until March 
          and the South coast without any ice (sniolans j&ouml;r).[10] There&shy;fore, 
          Columbus' statement, that the sea wasn&#8217;t frozen during the time 
          he was there[11] must be reasonable.</p>
        <p> A second argument against the trip has been Columbus' ob&shy;servation 
          of strong tidal movements. He wrote that he witnessed great mareas (tides), 
          leading twice daily to a difference of about 25 brazas in the levels 
          between low and high tide.[12] Ruddock, while acknowledging a warm winter 
          in 1477 and contemporary excur&shy;sions to Greenland, nevertheless 
          concludes that Columbus never went there because of this crucial question 
          of the implausibly ex&shy;treme tides.[13] According to her, 25 brazas 
          means nearly fifty feet, an unacceptably high tidal rise indeed; therefore 
          it must have been impossible for anybody to have actually witnessed 
          the event. Rud&shy;dock didn't, however, take into consideration the 
          essay of Graefe, who reasoned, that Columbus' braccia probably meant 
          a covid (0.4886 m), an Arabic yardstick still used in Spain at that 
          time: This would reduce the tidal movement to an acceptable 12 meters 
          (39.37 feet).[14] Furthermore, new arguments have arisen in favor of 
          Columbus' observation concerning the tides. Recent studies about the 
          Earth's climate and the warming due to the greenhouse effect show that 
          the changes in climate, especially at the beginning of the &quot;little 
          ice age&quot; from 1450 on, have caused extreme tidal move&shy;ments, 
          which might have led to the abandoning of the Viking do&shy;minions 
          in Greenland at that time.[15] If the tides had got stronger in that 
          region, why shouldn't Columbus have drawn attention to that fact?</p>
        <p>Apart from the climatic arguments, there is another state&shy;ment 
          by Columbus which should be discussed, namely, that the English, especially 
          those from Bristol, went to the mentioned is&shy;land with their wares. 
          It is known, that the British went regularly to Iceland, especially 
          during the cod-fishing season, which lasted from January through March[16], 
          but there are no documents offi&shy;cially confirming that these sailors 
          also went to Greenland. Despite the political situation of that period 
          in England, one nevertheless gets some hints that trips to Greenland 
          on the part of the British took place. According to the sources quoted 
          by the Norwegian his&shy;torian Torno&euml;, the Danish-Norwegian kings 
          made several treaties with the English trying to ban them from Iceland 
          and Greenland; and because of the harm especially wrought by the &quot;pirates&quot; 
          from Bristol, war broke out between Denmark-Norway and England in 1467.[17] 
          King Alfonso V. of Portugal, an ally of the Scandinavian crown, first 
          initiated in the 1470s a long lasting co-expedition to Greenland with 
          the admirals Pining-Pothorst and Jo&atilde;o Vaz Corte Real. It is known, 
          that the sailors had to build big landmarks not only in Sn&auml;ffelsj&ouml;kull 
          (Iceland), but also in Huitserk (Greenland), in order to make clear 
          that the land was still in the possession of the Danish king Christian 
          I.[18] This co-expedition, which is also documented by the chronicler 
          Gaspar Fructuosa (1520-1590) [19], corresponds somewhat with Columbus' 
          remarks about the sailors of Bristol going there with their wares. The 
          latter were considered by the Danish as competitors and rivals, trying 
          to force their way into the richer fishing and hunting fields on the 
          Canadian Atlantic coast.[20] The Portuguese-Danish expedition in the 
          1470s was there&shy;fore part of a military intervention against the 
          commercial activi&shy;ties of the English, especially those from Bristol 
          (also mentioned by Christopher Columbus). In 1480, men from Bristol 
          launched a highly equipped expedition in search of a legendary island 
          called Brasylle, later identified by Williamson and Quinn as the coasts 
          of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia[21]. The expedition failed, mainly because 
          they tried to reach it directly from Ireland. In my opinion, these facts 
          &#8211; that there was an interest in the region laying further West 
          than Iceland, especially in Greenland as a base for further expeditions, 
          are founded on solid evidence. The arguments against the passage are 
          not strong enough to disprove Columbus' state&shy;ments.</p>
        <p>In 1477, the future discoverer of America had already arrived in Portugal 
          and married a Portuguese noblewoman. Why could he not have sailed with 
          the Portuguese, who were exhorted by papal decrees since 1455 to discover 
          the (is)lands of the Atlantic? The Portuguese king Alfonso V, allied 
          to the Danish-Norwegian king&shy;dom by family ties[22], initiated the 
          mentioned expedition to the Arc&shy;tic in the early '70s. In 1476, 
          another large expedition with several captains and ships was sent out 
          under the command of admiral Jan Scolvus, and it is well known that 
          this trip led at least as far as the East coast of Greenland.[23] Starting 
          out in 1476, the Jan Scolvus expedition reached Iceland and Greenland 
          not earlier than winter 1477. Christopher Columbus could have joined 
          this particular ex&shy;pedition in Iceland, after having made a stay 
          in Galway, which was the main harbor on the way.[24] Why should this 
          trip, which seems to have followed the tracks of the Vikings, not have 
          inspired Christopher Columbus? Even if he didn't accompany the Jan Scol&shy;vus 
          expedition to the very end &#8211; according to Torno&euml;, Scolvus 
          al&shy;most rounded Baffin Island &#8211; the trip must have made an 
          impact on him, strengthening his will to continue his exploration of 
          the Atlantic Sea.</p>
        <p>The critical reader might ask at least, why Columbus didn't mention 
          his trip to the North in any subsequent text. To answer this question, 
          one has to take into consideration two facts: First, that all of his 
          documents concerning the time before 1492 have disappeared, and second, 
          that Christopher Columbus was obvi&shy;ously not interested in clearing 
          up this part of his biography in later years. It seems, that he hesitated 
          publicly to remember the seafaring experiences he made in the decades 
          before arriving in Spain &#8211; especially after his deprivation of 
          power in the year 1500. The Spanish government, according to Bartolom&eacute; 
          de las Casas, had suspected him and his brothers of being guilty of 
          high treason and it would have been for him negligent to draw attention 
          to expedi&shy;tions that he had made for other kingdoms, some of them 
          hostile to Spain. </p>

          Greenland was still alive in the 15th cent. (in 1448 Icelandic Annals 
          re&shy;port nine churches and congregations), although many Greenlanders 
          had already emigrated to Canada because of better living conditions 
          there. Greenland continued in the 15th century the trading with &quot;Vine&shy;land&quot;, 
          which had, according to bills, delivered products like Elk, black bear, 
          ermine, glutton lynx, otter, sable and wolf (animals which were hunted 
          in Newfoundland or Canada). <br>

          [24] According to Torno&euml;, Greenland became a base of operations 
          for the search of the Northwest Passage to Asia in those years, and 
          the Jan Scol&shy;vus expedition was dedicated to this goal. An English 
          document from about 1575 says that Jan Scolus, a pilot of Denmarke, 
          was in the north side of the passage from the North Sea (the Arctic 
          Ocean) to the South Sea (the Pacific Ocean); this passage was called 
          the Narrowe Sea or Streicte of the three Brethren and at no time in 
          the year ice would be found there, because of the swift running down 
          of sea into sea, T. iden&shy;tified this Streicte as Jones Sound or 
          Lancaster Sound because of a globe, made by Gemma Frisius and Gerhard 
          Mercator (1537), showing a Fretum trium fratrum.</font></p>
